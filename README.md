## Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This project aims to predict whether the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land, a critical factor in reducing the overall launch cost. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 launches at $62 million, significantly lower than other providers, thanks to its reusable first stage. By predicting the success of the first stage landing, we can estimate launch costs, which is useful for companies competing against SpaceX for contracts.
